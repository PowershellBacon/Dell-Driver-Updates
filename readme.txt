Dell Command | Update is installed as a standalone 
application on a business client supported platform to provide a Windows update 
experience for systems software released by Dell. This application is installed 
locally on the target systems and simplifies BIOS, firmware, drivers, and 
application update experience on Dell Client Hardware.  This application can also
be used to install drivers after the Operating System and network drivers are 
installed based on the system identity.  

Dell Command | Update is primarily targeted at customers who want to manage 
systems on their own. The tool is designed to allow users to specify their 
update preferences and apply updates based on the criticality. Alternatively, 
end users can use the scheduling option to keep their system up-to-date with 
the systems software released by Dell.

The command line scripting mode of the tool allows administrators to use their 
automated remote deployment infrastructure for their updates.
